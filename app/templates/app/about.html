                            <p>
                            My journey into backend development started with a curiosity for how websites work. Learning Python through Hablu Programmer YouTube channel and diving into Django, I discovered a passion for solving problems with code.
                               
                            Completing my first job portal website was a turning point, showcasing my ability to turn ideas into functional solutions. Today, I’m focused on building scalable, user-friendly web applications while continuously growing and exploring new possibilities.
